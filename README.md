# Hello! I'm Juan 👋

안녕하세요, 스페인에서 온 후안입니다. 웹 개발이 좋아서 혼자서 프론트엔드를 공부하고 있습니다. 현재는 주로 Vue.js를 배우고 있고 앞으로는 백엔드까지 할 수 있는 풀스택 개발자를 목표로 하고 있습니다.

<br>

I'm currently self-studying web development, primarily focused on the frontend with the Vue.js framework but with aim to include backend in the future. 

I am also fluent in Spanish, English and Korean.
